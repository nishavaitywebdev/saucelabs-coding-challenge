1) In component App first fetch data from server by calling api '/getPlotPoints'.
2) When component mounts, the data is provided to Chart component by setting its 'data' prop.
3) Chart component processes the data as required and displays the chart. Chart component also
takes in a unique visualizationId so that the component can be reused by passing unique id every time.
4) I am using Highcharts library for plotting charts.
5) The scatter points can be selected/deselected(to select multiple, command+click).
